Introduction
-----------------

### Scenario Description

Sign language recognition and classification using machine learning in social robots can be used in contexts of interaction with deaf-mute people. They use sign language as their primary form of communication. Integrating sign language capability into social robots allows them to communicate more effectively, creating a more natural and fluid interaction. A second important aspect is accessibility. Social robots can act as intermediaries between deaf-mute people and the outside world, helping them communicate with other people, access information and solve everyday problems.

Unfortunately deaf-mute people often face challenges in social interaction due to language barriers. Social robots that can communicate using sign language can help overcome these barriers, fostering social interaction and reducing the social isolation that people with hearing impairments often experience.

Machine learning and classification techniques can be used to train social robots to recognize gestures and sign language expressions. This requires building annotated datasets containing images or videos of sign language gestures and training machine learning models to recognize them in real time.

In conclusion, the use of sign language in social robots promotes accessibility, autonomy and the reduction of social isolation for people with hearing impairments, enabling them to participate more fully in society.
